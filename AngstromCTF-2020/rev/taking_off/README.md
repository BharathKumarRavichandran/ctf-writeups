# Taking Up

### How I tried?
* Less than 3 args- `./taking_off 1 2 3`
    ```
    So you figured out how to provide input and command line arguments.
    But can you figure out what input to provide?
    Make sure you have the correct amount of command line arguments!
    ```

* Four arguments - `./taking_off 1 2 3 4`
    ```
    So you figured out how to provide input and command line arguments.
    But can you figure out what input to provide?
    Don't try to guess the arguments, it won't work.
